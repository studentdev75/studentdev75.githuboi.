    <h1>The History of Lamborghini</h1>
    
    <p>
        The story begins with <b>Ferruccio Lamborghini</b> in Italy, he is well know in the world by making <i>tractors</i>
        
    <blockquote>
    
                 <q> "should i build a car ?" </q>
    </blockquote>
    
<p>
But here was already <b> Enzo Ferrary </b> , the creator of <em> Ferrary </em> once said ..

    <blockquote>
                 <q> "You may know how to drive a tractor, but you will never know how to handle a Ferrari! </q>
         

<p>
   Proving him wrong , <strong>Ferruccio Lamborghini</strong> finally presents <i>Automobili Lamborghini</i> in 1963. The <cite>350 GT</cite>

      <blockquote>
      
      <i> Today, Lamborghini stands as a symbol of luxury, speed, and engineering excellenceâ€”built not just from metal, but from a dream. </i>
